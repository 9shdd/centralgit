commands........
#ansible --list nodes To check all connected nodes
1. Ad-hoc commands... use -a
NOTE: idempotancy is present means overrite the task, again and again does the task
#ansible grpname -a 'ls or ls -a or pwd' or #ansible demo[0] -a 'useradd malik'
#ansible grpname -a 'sudo yum install httpd -y'  or #ansible all -ba 'yum install httpd -y'  [a for argument, b for become, sudo basically]

2. modules........ use -m
NOTE: idempotancy is present means no overrite or repeat any task, it tells this/that already done or installed or created
#ansible demo -m setup  or # ansible demo -m setup -a 'filter=*ipv4*'  [this setup module basically tells the current configuration]
#ansible demo -b -m yum -a 'pkg=httpd state=present or install'     [present for install]
#ansible demo -b -m yum -a 'pkg=httpd state=absent'               [absent for remove]
#ansible demo -b -m yum -a 'pkg=httpd state=latest'              [latest for update]
#ansible demo -b -m service -a 'name=httpd state=started'      [started for service start]
#ansible demo -b -m user -a 'name=malik'
#ansible demo -b -m user -a 'name=malik state=absent'        [absent for user remove]
#ansible demo -b -m copy -a 'src=testfile dest=/tmp'
