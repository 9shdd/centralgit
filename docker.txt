docker is an open source centralized platform designed to create deploy and run applications.
we can install docker on any OS but it runs natively on linux distribution.
docker written in 'go' language.
docker tool that performs os level virtualization while vm hardware level.
docker also known as containerization
docker is set of 'paas' service.
Advantages: no pre allocation of RAM
            less cost
            it is light in weight
            
NOTE: when image is runs called container
DockerHub/Rejistery: docker rejistery manage and sores the docker images.
there are 2 types of rejistery 1 is private(used to share images within enterprise), 2 is public(also called as docker hub).
Docker images: docker images are read only binary templates used to create docker container OR single file with all dependencies.
THERE ARE 3 WAYS TO CREATE AN IMAGES: take images from docker hub
                                      create image from docker file
                                      create image from existing docker container
Docker container: container hold the entire packages related to run the application
                  in simple word container is like a virtual machine
                  image becomes container when image runs on docker engine
