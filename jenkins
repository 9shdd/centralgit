JENKINS..............
what is CI/CD pipeline?
continious integration is basically continious build + continious testing.
jenkins is an open source project written in java, it is runs on almost all os.
jenkins port number is 8080
jenkins automate the entire software development life cycle.
jenkins was originally developed by sun microsystem in 2004
whenever developers write a code we integrate all developers code at that point of time we build and test and deliver/deploy to the clinet
this process is called CI/CD.
because of CI bugs will be reported fast and get rectified fast so the entire software development fast.
Workflow of jenkins...
we can attach git(central repo), maven(building tool/plugins), selenium(testting tool/plugins) and artifactory plugins to jenkins.
once developers push the code in github, jenkins pull the code and sent to maven for build
once build is done, jenkins pull the code and send to selenium for testing
once testing is done, jenkins pull the code and artifactory(archive purpose for future) as per reqiurement and so on
we can deploy with jenkins also
Advantages of jenkins........
jenkins has lot of plugins
you can write own plugin, because it is not just a tool it is framework
you can also use community plugin
jenkins is a master and slave architecure if the slave is avalibale then jenkins does the job as a master
jenkins also support the job/task scheduling 
jenkins create a lables also means we can set this task will does this person something like this.

9 -->git credentials manager core -->chech the enable file system caching checkbox -->Install
goto the cmd promt and configure the git
#git --version
#git config --global user.name 'give-user-name'
#git config --global user.email 'give-email-id'
check # git config --list

Now download the jdk kit (java development kit)
1 download the jdk from chrome
2 thne goto c drive->programfiles->jdk 16->select path and copy it
search 'edit system environment variables' ->goto user variables ->new type 'variable name-JAVA_HOME'
'variable-value-PASTE THE COPIED PATH HERE'
Now goto system variable ->new variable name-JAVA_HOME varaible value-paste the path here
NOW goto again inside program files folder->bin and paste the path
again goto 'edit system environment variables'->system variables->path->new->paste the path
Now verify in cmnd promt echo%JAVA_HOME%

Maven download and configure
goto chrome searh maven.apache.org ->download binary zip archive
extract file ->C:DevTools
goto c drive->DevTtools->apache->maven ->copy this path
now goto the system variables->new variavle name-M2_Home ,variable value-paste the copied path
now goto apache->maven->bin->folder->copy this path
now again goto envrnt variable ->system variavles->path->paste the copied bin path
now goto cmd promt-> check #mvn -version, # echo %M2_HOME%
restart the laptop

now download and configure jenkins
goto chrome ->jenkins.io->download->select long term support(LTS)
open downloaded file and run->install
after installation it automatically open on as localhost:8080
unlock the page by giving default path of password then unlock using password
now isntall these sudgested plugins 
username admin, password any, email , save and continue
Plugins-> these are small kind of libraries that add new abilities to jenkins and can provide integration to other tools
